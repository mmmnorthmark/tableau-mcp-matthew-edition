# Claude Code Project Instructions

## Todoist Integration

This project is integrated with Todoist for task management. **Read `.claude/todoist.md` at the start of every session** for the full configuration and rules.

### Quick Reference - Inviolable Rules

1. **ONE PROJECT ONLY**: All Todoist operations are scoped to the bound project (Tableau MCP Server). Never touch other projects.

2. **GTD Methodology**: We follow David Allen's Getting Things Done.

3. **T-Shirt Sizing Required**: Every task gets a size label:
   - `1. Big Thing`, `2. Medium Thing`, `3. Small Thing`, `4. Tiny Thing`

4. **Context Labels**: Use `Desktop`, `Online`, `Offline` as applicable.

5. **Break Down Projects**: Tasks with subtasks = projects. Break big things into actionable chunks.

6. **Reuse Labels**: Always check existing labels before creating new ones.

7. **NEVER DELETE TASKS**: To cancel, add `Cancelled` label THEN mark complete.
